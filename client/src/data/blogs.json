            "Welcome to Meta! You’ve certainly impressed many people to get to where you are now, so take a moment to give yourself a pat on the back. No, seriously - [PAUSE FOR BACK PAT]",
            "There are lots of things in store for you during this internship, but the first week can definitely be an onslaught of information and to-dos. Here is a large overview of the major milestones you’re going to complete, as well as some tips and tricks for getting acclimated to Meta during your first week! (KEEP IN MIND: some of these instructions may change depending on the state of remote/hybrid/in-person work over the next year)",
            "Day 1: If you’ve relocated for your internship, you’ll be given a temporary Uber voucher to go to the Meta offices, pick up your required tech package, (perhaps take some fun pictures) and head back to your residence to complete your tech setup. Setup issues and troubleshooting can be very common, so be persistent if your technology takes a while to set up: if you get stuck, ask intern buddies or contact someone at Meta that could help. After your tech is set up, you will complete your first day orientation activities and successfully complete your Day 1!",
            "Day 2: You will continue onboarding sessions today, staying at home to complete them. Your Outlook email/calendar and/or provided documents will indicate what meetings you should have. Join these meetings and have fun learning more about Meta!",        
            "Tip: Use the MetaU Hub’s File Upload tool to save scheduling documents for future reference!",        
            "Day 3: Welcome to Wednesday! Many new developments today. Firstly, you will be coming into the office for the first time today. If you’ve set up your phone successfully, you should have access to a mobile badge via the Facebook Home app. You can present this to the shuttle driver to board the Meta shuttles.",
            "Tip: If you don’t know what shuttle to take to get to the office, the shuttle timetable tool is conveniently linked on the sidebar of this website!",
            "Once you get to the office, you’ll have instructions on how to pick up your physical badge. If you’re at MPK, use the intercampus shuttles (Red/Gold lines) to get to where you need to go. If you can’t make it to the badging event, no worries - you can get a temporary badge from any office security desk, and then get an official badge the following day from one of the campus badge hubs.",
            "Finally, the main event of Day 3: the first day of your CodePath Bootcamp. More details can be found under the CodePath Bootcamp entry, but this will be your introduction to the bootcamp and to your fellow cohort of interns. Join a group of interns for lunch and get to know each other!",
            "Days 4 and 5: The end of the week will be mostly focused on CodePath. You might have other meetings like 1-1s with your manager or recruiter, and you might still have issues that were not resolved earlier in the week. Now’s the time to get further settled before the end of your first week. Get to know more friends, explore more food options, and most of all, enjoy yourself. Congratulations again, and have a great first week!",
            "Tip: The MetaU Hub Intern Discovery tool allows you to find out more about your fellow MetaU interns - you might see them around!"

            "The CodePath Bootcamp will make up the first 3 weeks of your internship. While I (probably) shouldn’t spoil the assignments you’ll be working on, here is an overview of the topics you will learn each week.",
            "Week 1: Intro to HTML, CSS, and JS (Assignment 1 due Friday)",
            "Week 2: React and Axios (Assignment 2.1 due Friday)",
            "Week 3: Storing Data (Assignment 2.2 due Friday)",
            "There are weekly assignments that require a submission through CodePath of a GitHub repository and short demo video (in the readme) to be marked as complete. Each assignment has a 72-hour extension if needed, but try to get the bulk of your work done ahead of time.",
            "Tip: CodePath is conveniently linked on the sidebar of this website! ",
            "The bootcamp is no easy task, it takes a lot of programmers months to learn all of these skills, but you’ll be working with instructors, TAs, and other provided resources to learn them all in the span of 3 weeks. Always remember to ask questions if you get stuck, because time is valuable to develop your assignments. Good luck, you’ve got this!"

        "content": [
            "Your midpoint review is expected during Week 4, right after completing the CodePath bootcamp. It’s a good opportunity to evaluate your body of work and celebrate your successes and achievements with your manager. Your independent feedback should focus on the Intern Axes of Performance to help your manager frame your progress during their calibration session with your intern director. Be open and honest about your strengths and weaknesses so that you can get the most relevant feedback possible.",
            "You’ll hear official feedback from your manager (and perhaps your recruiter) during Week 5. It’s a good chance to know what you’ve been excelling in, and what you can improve on as the rest of your internship plays out."

        "title": "Independent Project Development", 
        "content": [
            "After finishing CodePath, you’ll begin developing your independent capstone project. Although Meta University is 10 weeks, the capstone project development process will take place mostly from Weeks 4 through 9, so it may be less time than you expect. Here are some tips to organize your project work to maximize productivity.",
            "Week 4: By the start of Week 4, you should have already brainstormed a concept for your capstone project, as in, what is the real-world problem your app will solve or alleviate? It’s a very open-ended question, but it gives you the liberty to build something that is interesting and fulfilling to you! The more invested in your own idea you are, the better work you will produce. From here, you will probably start a planning phase for your project, which can take several different forms.",
            "Planning: You can choose to design a wireframe using Figma or a comparable tool, write a project plan that includes problem overview, user stories, and technical features, or a timeline that will outline what steps you will take chronologically to develop the MVP (minimum viable product) - whatever helps you get a sense of what you will create and how you will create it. You should be able to present these materials to your intern manager or project peer, and they should be able to understand your project on a deeper level and give you feedback to begin coding.",
            "Project Requirements: There are certain basic requirements needed for all MetaU independent projects; they will be shared with you. Make sure your project will incorporate these features. Most importantly are the two “technically complex” features that will be designated by you. This task is the most ambiguous, so don’t be afraid to ask your intern manager for advice on what is deemed “technically complex” or not. Also, try to get to these tasks as soon as possible; the earlier you get them done, it not only gives you more time to complete stretch features, but shows your manager that you can work quickly and ahead of schedule.",
            "Coding: The coding process can look very different for everyone, but here are a couple of notes about how to make your life easier: If you ever get stuck on a particular feature for more than a day, reach out to your intern manager or project peer; in the best case, they can quickly help you solve the issue, and in the worst case (which has happened to me), you might have to completely scrap a feature or rethink your design. This is okay - be adaptable and amenable to change. You should also be committing changes frequently and pull requesting whenever a new feature is complete. In your pull request, it is also nice to include a short video clip of your new feature in action to give viewers a better sense of the state of the project.",            
            "Building an independent, fully realized application in six weeks or less is no easy feat. But, if you’ve gotten through the bootcamp, you certainly have what it takes to complete your project. Even if your project doesn’t end up perfect (which it definitely won’t, take it from me), the bottom line is that you should trust your vision and challenge yourself to make something you’re proud of. Best of luck!"

            "If you’re reading this, you’re probably approaching the end of your internship. Weirdly fast, right? Your final review is expected during Week 8, and much like the midpoint review, you will evaluate your internship progress by focusing on the Intern Axes of Performance.",
            "At the end of Week 9, you’ll be expected to submit a recorded demo of your independent capstone project through Workplace. You may also receive feedback from your intern manager this week or the next.",
            "And then, Week 10, the final week of your internship, will be a relaxed send-off. You’ll have some short bootcamp sessions introducing you to the Meta codebase, and you’ll have time throughout the day to work on de-orientation and any final project needs. You may end up presenting your project to your team, in a forum of MetaU interns, or if you’re me, you’ll be writing this blog post!",
            "I hope you are taking away something personal from this internship, and it can be different for everyone. You may find that your favorite part was the engaging project work you completed, or it might be the micro-kitchens. It might be your fellow interns and the memories you made with them. Regardless, take a moment to appreciate the hard work you put in, and have a great time wrapping up your time at Meta!"
